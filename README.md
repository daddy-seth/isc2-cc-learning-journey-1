Welcome to my cybersecurity learning journal! This repository documents my progress as I prepare for and study the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) certification — an internationally recognized entry-level credential for aspiring cybersecurity professionals.
So far, I’ve covered three out of five domains, and I’m excited to share my notes, reflections, and practical takeaways.
 Domain 1: Security Principles
In this domain, I learned the core concepts that define cybersecurity, including:

The CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability

Security controls: Preventive, Detective, and Corrective

Threat types (malware, social engineering, insider threats)

The importance of defense-in-depth

Concepts of risk management, governance, and security frameworks

✅ Key takeaway: Cybersecurity is not just about tools — it's about managing risk and aligning with business objectives.

Domain 2: Business Continuity (BC), Disaster Recovery (DR), and Incident Response
This domain introduced me to resilience planning, including:

Business continuity plans (BCP) and how organizations stay operational during disruption

Disaster recovery plans (DRP) — restoring systems after incidents

Incident response lifecycle: Preparation, Detection, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned



✅ Key takeaway: Every organization should prepare for failure — because resilience starts with planning.

 Domain 3: Access Control Concepts
In this domain, I explored how organizations control access to data and systems:

Identification, Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (IAAA)

Types of authentication factors: Something you know, have, are, etc.

Access control models: RBAC, MAC, DAC, ABAC

Password policies, MFA (multi-factor authentication), and least privilege

The principle of Zero Trust and segmentation

✅ Key takeaway: Strong access control is the first line of defense against unauthorized activity.
