Welcome to my cybersecurity learning journal! This repository documents my progress as I prepare for and study the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) certification — an internationally recognized entry-level credential for aspiring cybersecurity professionals.
So far, I’ve covered three out of five domains, and I’m excited to share my notes, reflections, and practical takeaways.
 Domain 1: Security Principles
In this domain, I learned the core concepts that define cybersecurity, including:

The CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability

Security controls: Preventive, Detective, and Corrective

Threat types (malware, social engineering, insider threats)

The importance of defense-in-depth

Concepts of risk management, governance, and security frameworks

✅ Key takeaway: Cybersecurity is not just about tools — it's about managing risk and aligning with business objectives.

Domain 2: Business Continuity (BC), Disaster Recovery (DR), and Incident Response
This domain introduced me to resilience planning, including:

Business continuity plans (BCP) and how organizations stay operational during disruption

Disaster recovery plans (DRP) — restoring systems after incidents

Incident response lifecycle: Preparation, Detection, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned



✅ Key takeaway: Every organization should prepare for failure — because resilience starts with planning.

 Domain 3: Access Control Concepts
In this domain, I explored how organizations control access to data and systems:

Identification, Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (IAAA)

Types of authentication factors: Something you know, have, are, etc.

Access control models: RBAC, MAC, DAC, ABAC

Password policies, MFA (multi-factor authentication), and least privilege

The principle of Zero Trust and segmentation

✅ Key takeaway: Strong access control is the first line of defense against unauthorized activity.

## 🛡️ Domain 4: Network Security – Completed

📚 **(ISC)² Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) Training**

This section of the course focused on the fundamentals of network security, including:

- 🔐 Network security devices and technologies (firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPNs)
- 🌐 Common network threats (DDoS, spoofing, MITM attacks)
- 🛠️ Security controls and network hardening techniques
- 🧱 Segmentation and secure network design principles
- 🔄 Importance of monitoring and logging network activity

📌 **Key Takeaway:** Understanding network security is essential for protecting digital infrastructure and supporting secure operations—especially as I pursue a career in **SOC/Blue Team roles**.

✅ Domain 5 Completed: Security Operations
As part of my ISC2 CC learning journey, I’ve completed Domain 5: Security Operations.

Key areas covered include:

Basics of security monitoring and alerting

Incident response lifecycle

Importance of business continuity and disaster recovery planning

Digital forensics fundamentals

Understanding of SOC roles and responsibilities

📌 This milestone is documented as part of my broader commitment to cybersecurity learning and readiness for the ISC2 CC exam.

I'm pleased to share that I’ve successfully completed the Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) Course Pre-assessment from ISC2.

This marks a key step in my journey toward earning the full ISC2 CC certification, validating my foundational knowledge in essential areas of cybersecurity such as:

🔐 Security Principles
🛡️ Risk Management
💾 Asset Management
👤 Identity & Access Control
⚙️ Security Operations

This pre-assessment completion is valid for 3 years and shows my readiness to take on real-world cybersecurity challenges and further certifications.

📄 Issued to: Charles Mordi
📅 Valid for: 3 years
🎯 Credential: ISC2 CC – Course Pre-assessment

🧠 Next Step: I'm continuing to build hands-on experience through labs and learning platforms like TryHackMe, CyberDefenders, and more as I aim for an entry-level role in SOC or GRC.
